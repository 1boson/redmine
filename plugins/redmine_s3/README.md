# S3 plugin for Redmine

## Description
This Redmine[http://www.redmine.org] plugin makes file attachments be stored on "Amazon S3"[http://aws.amazon.com/s3] rather than on the local filesystem.

## Installation
1. Make sure Redmine is installed and cd into it's root directory
2. `git clone git://github.com/ka8725/redmine_s3.git plugins/redmine_s3`

4. Edit config/s3.yml with your favourite editor

7. `rm -Rf plugins/redmine_s3/.git` 

## Options Overview
* The bucket specified in s3.yml will be created automatically when the plugin is loaded (this is generally when the server starts).
* *Deprecated* (no longer supported, specify endpoint option instead) If you have created a CNAME entry for your bucket set the cname_bucket option to true in s3.yml and your files will be served from that domain.
* After files are uploaded they are made public, unless private is set to true.
* Public and private files can use HTTPS urls using the secure option
* Files can use private signed urls using the private option
* Private file urls can expire a set time after the links were generated using the expires option
