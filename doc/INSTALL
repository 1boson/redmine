== Requirements

* Ruby on Rails 1.2.5 or 2.0.1
* A database (see compatibility below)

Optional:
* SVN binaries >= 1.3 (needed for repository browsing, must be available in PATH)
* RMagick (gantt export to png)

Supported databases:
* MySQL (tested with MySQL 5)
* PostgreSQL (tested with PostgreSQL 8.1)
* SQLite (tested with SQLite 3)


== Installation

1. Uncompress the program archive
   
2. Create an empty database: "redmine" for example

3. Configure database parameters in config/database.yml
   for "production" environment (default database is MySQL)

4. Create the database structure. Under the application main directory:
   rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
   It will create tables and an administrator account.

5. Test the installation by running WEBrick web server:
   ruby script/server -e production   
  
   Once WEBrick has started, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/
   You should now see the application welcome page

6. Use default administrator account to log in:
   login: admin
   password: admin
   
7. Go to "Administration" to load the default configuration data (roles, 
   trackers, statuses, workflow) and adjust application settings


== SMTP server Configuration

In config/environment.rb, you can set parameters for your SMTP server:
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings: SMTP server configuration
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries: set to false to disable mail delivering

Don't forget to restart the application after any change to this file.
