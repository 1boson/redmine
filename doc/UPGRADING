3. Copy your database settings (RAILS_ROOT/config/database.yml)
   into the new config directory
   
4. Enter your SMTP settings in config/environment.rb
   Do not replace this file with the old one
   
5. Migrate your database (please make a backup before doing this):
   rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"

6. Copy the RAILS_ROOT/files directory content into your new installation

Note 1: Rails 1.2.6 or higher is required

Note 2: when upgrading your code with svn update, don't forget to clear
the application cache (RAILS_ROOT/tmp/cache) before restarting.
