== Upgrading from 0.3.0 and above

1. Uncompress program archive in a new directory:
   tar zxvf <filename>
   
3. Copy your database settings (database.yml) into the new config directory
   
4. Migrate your database:
   rake migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
   
   
== From 0.2.x and below

Due to major database changes since 0.2.x, there is no migration support
from 0.2.x and previous versions.
