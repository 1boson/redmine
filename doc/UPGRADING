== Upgrading from 0.3.0 and above

1. Uncompress program archive in a new directory:
   tar zxvf <filename>
   
3. Copy your database settings (database.yml) into the new config directory
   
4. Migrate your database:
   rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"

Note 1: Rails 1.2.2 is required for version 0.4.2 and later.

Note 2: when upgrading your code with svn update, don't forget to clear
the application cache (RAILS_ROOT/tmp/cache) before restarting.

Note 3: settings previously defined in custom_config.rb are now stored
in database, as of version 0.4.2. Go to "Admin -> Settings" to edit them.

   
== From 0.2.x and below

Due to major database changes since 0.2.x, there is no migration support
from 0.2.x and previous versions.
