== Upgrading from 0.3.0 and above

1. Uncompress the program archive in a new directory
   
3. Copy your database settings (RAILS_ROOT/config/database.yml)
   into the new config directory
   
4. Enter your SMTP settings in config/environment.rb
   Do not replace this file with the old one
   
5. Migrate your database (please make a backup before doing this):
   rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"

6. Copy the RAILS_ROOT/files directory content into your new installation

Note 1: Rails 1.2.2 or higher is required for version 0.4.2 and later.
This release won't work with Rails 2.0

Note 2: when upgrading your code with svn update, don't forget to clear
the application cache (RAILS_ROOT/tmp/cache) before restarting.

Note 3: settings previously defined in custom_config.rb are now stored
in database, as of version 0.4.2. Go to "Admin -> Settings" to edit them.

   
== From 0.2.x and below

Due to major database changes since 0.2.x, there is no migration support
from 0.2.x and previous versions.
